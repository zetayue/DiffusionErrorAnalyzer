# DiffusionErrorAnalyzer
Python class to calculate ionic conductivity and its statistical error with AIMD data input


"Diffusion_error_analyzer.py" is the file used in Pymatgen(http://pymatgen.org/), a Python lib for materials analysis. It can calculate ionic conductivity as well as analyze its statistical error with ab initio MD raw data calculated from VASP(http://www.vasp.at/).

"MSD_analyzer.py" is the file used to do I/O transport after applying Diffusion_error_analyzer.
